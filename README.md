# childress-gilbert-GAFD-2024

# This repository is for scripts to recreate figures in the paper:

# Axial flow in an eroding Euler hairpin in R^3: does it prevent blow-up

# by Stephen Childress and Andrew D Gilbert
# Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics 2025

# Scripts for other figures are available on any reasonable request to the authors

# table_2_for_github:

# is a matlab scrip which incorporates the data for the first 5 columns of table 2 (see paper I for more information)
# and calculates the last 3 columns.

# figure_3_for_github

# is a matlab script which recreates figure 3 from the paper by stepping the level 1 systems of 3 ODEs

# figure_4_5_for_github 

# is a matlab script which recreates figures 4 and 5 from the paper by stepping the levels N = 2, 3, 4 systems of 3 ODEs.
# The body of the script is written for any level N (for L(0,N), that is).

# figure_6_for_github

# is a matlab script which recreates figure 6 from the paper by stepping the level 4 systems of 3 ODEs. 
# The body of the script is written for any level N (for L(0,N), that is).
